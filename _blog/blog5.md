Let $T$ be an operator. A Neumann series is of the following form

$$
\sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}T^{i}.
$$

**Theorem**: Let $T$ be a bounded linear operator on a Banach space $X$. If the Neumann series converges in the operator norm, then $I-T$ is invertible and its inverse is given by

$$
(I - T)^{-1} = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}T^{i},
$$

where $I$ is the identity operator.

**Theorem**:
