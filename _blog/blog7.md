**Theorem**: If the product $AB$ is invertible, then both $A$ and $B$ are invertible.

**Proposition**: Let $A$ and $B$ be invertible matrices. If one of the following conditions is satisfied, then $A+B$ is invertible:  
- $I + A^{-1}B$ is invertible
- $sp(A^{-1}B) \notin -1$
- $\rho(A^{-1}B) < 1$
- $A$ and $B$ are positive-definite
