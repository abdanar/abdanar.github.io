I obtained my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from **Middle East Technical University**, and I will be pursuing my master's degree at the **University of Münster** for the next two years. I have been awarded the [Mathematics Münster Full Grant Scholarship](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/careers/international/master/full-grant-scholarship.shtml) for one year, with the possibility of an extension for an additional year based on my performance. My area of interest is applied mathematics, specifically computational and numerical mathematics.
