I obtained my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from Middle East Technical University, and I will be pursuing my master's degree at the University of Münster for the next two years. I was awarded the Mathematics Münster Full Grant Scholarship for one year, with the possibility of extension for an additional year based on my performance. My area of interest is Applied Mathematics, specifically computational and numerical mathematics.
