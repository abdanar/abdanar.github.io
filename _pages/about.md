I obtained my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from **Middle East Technical University**, and I will be pursuing my master's degree at the **University of Münster** for the next two years. I have been awarded the [Mathematics Münster Full Grant Scholarship](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/careers/international/master/full-grant-scholarship.shtml#:~:text=The%20scholarship%20offers%20monthly%20payments,HOW%20TO%20APPLY%3F&text=a%20letter%20of%20motivation%20to%20pursue%20your%20Masters%20studies%20at%20M%C3%BCnster.) for one year, with the possibility of an extension for an additional year based on my performance. My area of interest is applied mathematics, specifically computational and numerical mathematics.
