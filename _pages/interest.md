## Student Seminar

I gave a student seminar series on the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**.

**Time and Locations:**

- 28 May: 13:40-15:30; Room M215
- 29 May: 13:40-15:30; Room M106
- 30 May: 13:40-15:30; Room M231
- 31 May: 13:40-15:30; Room M231

I used the following sources:

- S. C. Brenner and L. R. Scott, _The Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods_, 3rd ed., Springer, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-75934-0.
- Süli, E. (2020). Lecture Notes on Finite Element Methods for Partial Differential Equations. [Lecture notes]. Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.

For the implementation of the Finite Element Method for ODEs, I used Python.

## Projects

### Compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology

Below, you can find my project report and presentation for the Mathematical Modeling course (**IAM 567**). The focus of my project was **compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology**, and I delivered a talk on January 3rd, 2024, at the Institute of Applied Mathematics, METU.
