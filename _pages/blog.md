This is an experimental blog page that will be dedicated to important mathematical results (including theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc.). This page will serve as my dictionary when I am looking for something important. These results will cover everything from basic concepts to specific fields of mathematics. Of course, as I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, the majority of them will be expected to come from linear algebra, numerical analysis, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, optimization, and many more.
