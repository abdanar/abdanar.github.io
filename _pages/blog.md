This experimental blog page is dedicated to key mathematical results, including theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and algorithms. It will serve as a personal reference for quickly looking up important concepts. The content will cover everything from foundational ideas to specialized areas of mathematics. Given my interest in applied and computational mathematics, the majority of the content will focus on topics such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, optimization, and beyond.

[Invertibility of the sum of two invertible matrices](/blog/blog7) - possible conditions for the sum of two invertible matrices to be invertible  
[Matrix norms and inner products](/blog/blog6) - a list of matrix norms and inner products  
[Neumann series](/blog/blog5) - the Neumann series and its convergence criteria  
[AM–GM inequality](/blog/blog4) - an inequality of arithmetic and geometric means  
[Singular value decomposition](/blog/blog3) - a matrix decomposition  
[Grönwall's inequality](/blog/blog2) - an inequlaity used to bound a function that satisfies a certain differential inequality by the solution of the corresponding differential equation
