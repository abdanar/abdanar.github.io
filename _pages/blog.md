This is an experimental blog page dedicated to important mathematical results, including theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and more. It will serve as a personal reference when I need to look up something significant. The content will span from basic concepts to specific areas of mathematics. Of course, since I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, the majority of the content will focus on topics such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, optimization, and more.
